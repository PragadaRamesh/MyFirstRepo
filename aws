 A branch represents an independent line of development.
 The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
 The default branch name in Git is master.
COMMANDS:
 The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the 
remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't 
been pushed or merged yet. The branch is now deleted locally.
 Now all the things you have done is on your local system.
 GIT MERGE:
 Git merge is a command used in the Git version control system to combine changes from one 
branch.
 To merge: git merge branch_name 
allows you to work on di erent features or changes to your code independently, without 
a ecting the main or other branches.
 It's a way to organize and manage your code changes, making it easier to collaborate and 
maintain your project
